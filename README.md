# Story Maker

A lightweight React + Vite app for creating illustrated children's stories with AI. An adult works with a kid (who can't type yet) to build a character sheet and generate story page illustrations using the Gemini API.

## Features

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — paste your Gemini API key; nothing is stored on a server
- **Character Sheet** — define up to 4 characters with names and descriptions, then generate a character model sheet
- **Story Pages** — add illustrated pages with captions; each illustration uses the character sheet as a visual reference for consistency
- **Netlify-ready** — deploys with `netlify.toml` included

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and paste a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get started.

## Deploy

Push to a repo connected to Netlify — it will use the included `netlify.toml` to build and deploy automatically.
